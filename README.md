# Udacity-SDC-Radar-Driver-Micro-Challenge
Udacity Self-Driving Car Radar Driver Micro Challenge

## Purpose:
The Lincoln MKZ is currently getting a Radar overhaul. While it came with some stock sensors, we are adding an additional six radar emitters to the Udacity car in order to not only implement adaptive cruise control features, but to always have access to our surrounding environment and make lane changes and safe stops possible.

Unfortunately, our sensors arenâ€™t supported by ROS, the messaging and control architecture we are using for the whole system. For this first micro-challenge, we need help getting our computers recognizing the tracking data that these systems output.
